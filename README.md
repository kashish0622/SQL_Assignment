# SQL_Assignment

This repository contains SQL practice exercises focused on building strong fundamentals in data querying and analysis.

In this assignment, we created multiple tables, inserted structured datasets, and solved real-world analytical problems using SQL queries.

## The tasks involved:
1)Grouping and summarizing data
2)Extracting meaningful values from formatted strings
3)Filtering records using conditions
4)Applying analytical (window) functions and much more...

We worked on problems like analyzing product sales by date, calculating department-wise salaries and performing sales trend analysis using window functions.
The goal of this assignment was to understand how SQL can be used not just for data retrieval, but for data manipulation.
